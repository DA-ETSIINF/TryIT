* TryIT! docker-dev
** Usage
In order to use this development docker-compose:
 - Build the dev image using ~docker build -t tryit-web-dev .~
 - Run this compose with ~docker-compose up -d~
 - Run bash in the image with ~docker-compose exec web bash~
 - Run Django with ~python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000~

This docker-compose is meant to be used when developing, this new compose allows us to
run other services and link them to our web easily, making new features easy to deploy
(like using PostgreSQL rather than sqlite)
